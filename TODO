global bug and to do list

FIXME:
time warnings don't always show at the first opportunity to do so (intended behavior: once the right amount of time has passed, they show up at the end of a block of travis text)
	story.canContinue doesn't seem to be the right test for this, for instance it's true if there are nested choices even though intuitively it should be false there

TODO:
== plot ==

== code ==
create favicon
let users horizontally scroll the prompts using their vertical scroll wheels
scroll so that the next upcoming character in a prompt is always visible
add hotjar or inspectlet for user recording
	figure out which one is better
make all react components use `const { prop1, prop2, ... } = props` style so as to be more declarative
new tag for line that can be interrupted but travis will finish typing it out anyway and then respond to you

== admin ==
find beta testers
	post to interactive fiction sites
