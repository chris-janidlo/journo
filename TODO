global bug and to do list

FIXME:
player choice can be incorrectly rendered as travis text if the content changes in between choosing and printing (ie if the choice content includes a call to remaining_time_to_string)
player choice can be shown wrong if travis says the exact same thing
(two above bugs can be wrapped together: don't base message player status on text)

TODO:
== plot ==

== code ==
implement Travis leaving due to time
add ability to redirect to story content in develop mode
create favicon
let users horizontally scroll the prompts using their vertical scroll wheels
scroll so that the next upcoming character in a prompt is always visible
make error text in prompt change the background in addition to the characters
add hotjar or inspectlet for user recording
	figure out which one is better
make all react components use `const { prop1, prop2, ... } = props` style so as to be more declarative

== admin ==
find beta testers
	post to interactive fiction sites
