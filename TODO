global bug and to do list

FIXME:
time warnings don't always show at the first opportunity to do so (intended behavior: once the right amount of time has passed, they show up at the end of a block of travis text)
	story.canContinue doesn't seem to be the right test for this, for instance it's true if there are nested choices even though intuitively it should be false there
make size of messages fully responsive and not hardcoded
let top bar wrap lines

TODO:
== plot ==

== code ==
let users horizontally scroll the prompts using their vertical scroll wheels
scroll so that the next upcoming character in a prompt is always visible
add hotjar or inspectlet for user recording
	figure out which one is better
add accessability mode (lets you click options instead of typing them)
implement other accessability items, like aria tags
new tag for line that can be interrupted but travis will finish typing it out anyway and then respond to you

== admin ==
create Livedrop's brand identity
find beta testers
	post to interactive fiction sites
