global bug and to do list

FIXME:

TODO:
== plot ==

== code ==
implement Travis leaving due to time
add ability to redirect to story content in develop mode
create favicon
let users horizontally scroll the prompts using their vertical scroll wheels
scroll so that the next upcoming character in a prompt is always visible
make error text in prompt change the background in addition to the characters
add hotjar or inspectlet for user recording
	figure out which one is better
make all react components use `const { prop1, prop2, ... } = props` style so as to be more declarative
new tag for line that can be interrupted but travis will finish typing it out anyway and then respond to you
