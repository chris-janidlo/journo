global bug and to do list

FIXME:
player choice can be incorrectly rendered as travis text if the content changes in between choosing and printing (ie if the choice content includes a call to remaining_time_to_string)

TODO:
== plot ==

== code ==
implement Travis leaving due to time
create favicon
let users horizontally scroll the prompts using their vertical scroll wheels
scroll so that the next upcoming character in a prompt is always visible
add hotjar or inspectlet for user recording
	figure out which one is better

== admin ==
find beta testers
	post to interactive fiction sites
