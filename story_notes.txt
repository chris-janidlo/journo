outline from outer space
	establish contact with travis
	interview him about his scoop
	details emerge slowly that he isn't what he says he is
	you may or may not discover that travis is an alien and that facebook is all a big Bofaeockian conspiracy
	we leave journo and you are prompted to choose what kind of story you want to publish based off what you've learned
	you're told how your story impacts the world

whistleblower - Travis Wagner
	eccentric
		prone to UFO conspiracy theories
		hobbies
			flying things - planes, drones
			astronomy
			interested in freud and other early psychologists?
	senior level facebook engineer
		E7/M2 in facebook system
			just below director level
			highest level that seems to still touch code
			leads teams "as if they were small startups within the larger environment" (as someone on Quora said)
			major focus is user acquisition/retention
	arrogant
	socially awkward - more comfortable with his computer than with other people
	incredibly gifted programmer, competent (but not sparkling) people manager
	socially conscious, genuinely wants to do good, but often blind to the privilege of his position
		morally repulsed by project helen and its hasty implementation
		wants a legacy, to leave the world in a better place
		wants to improve humanity, both because he's come to love it and because he pities its current state
	says he comes from rich family, attended prestigious Valley highschool then UC Berkeley
		went to berkeley for bachelors and phd
		worked a series of startups until being hired to facebook a couple years ago
		this is all fake, of course, but he only had to convince the people interviewing/hiring him at facebook, and Bofaeockian mind-control tech makes these things easy
	is actually an alien from the planet Bofaeock
		TODO: name?
		basically a Bofaeockian astronaut - has a "phd," physically fit, years of loyal military service
		was on the mothership for years working on the master server, but was called down by Zark a couple years ago
		thinks that manipulating humans without their consent is disgusting, and is conflicted between this and loyalty to superiors/homeworld
		feels tricked into this job - was promised the opportunity to save his people, but not told that it would involve manipulating billions of people
		his actual alien personality is a lot more self-doubting, on account of the conflict

initial scoop
	encryption backdoor for us government
	selling camera/mic data
	banning all muslims
	banning political discussions
	setting up a data server in a nature reserve
	just fired high-up employee for reporting discriminatory behavior
	recommending users to be tracked by law enforcement if facebook predicts they will commit a crime
	intentionally showing depressing content to keep users addicted
	insider advertising - surfacing ads base on bribes
	discovered a way to project ads onto the real world
	shadow-banning all anti-facebook opinions
	not deleting a pedo group because a high ranking employee is a member
	top level of organization is a pedo ring
	turning in low-level drug users to police
	facebook is buying out MS Windows and replacing it with adware
	keeping a blacklist of any user with adblock and making the product subtly worse (load time, more negative posts) for those users
	literally killing puppies
	literally selling your data - instead of buying ads to target to a demographic, now you can just outright buy a list of people in a demographic or, worse, buy all the details of a specific user
	building data server on historical site
	propping up a totalitarian regime because that region has a lot of users
	making users delete any non-facebook-owned social media accounts in order to use any of their products
	stealing code from other companies
	installing adware on operating systems, after users click "ok" on an annoying pop-up
	calling hit jobs on engineers in competing companies
	assassinating politician in a region that has recently banned a facebook product
	if you try to delete your account, all your friends are alerted 

Bofaeock: a brief history
	highly technologically advanced, centuries beyond humans
		have developed wormhole-based FTL travel, but it's prohibitively expensive
			requires a shit ton of material resources
			may require exact knowledge of the location of your destination?
	once prosperous society, but they depleted their planet
		Bofaeock is only just barely alive - if they don't leave, they'll die within a generation
	scouting squad led by Zark Urckbemerg to find inhabitable planets
	they found that earth was close, and it looked promising
		when they arrived they realized it wouldn't work long term. TODO: working on why that is
		however, they realized that they could use humanity as a massive botnet to run their scouting software on
		established the scouting ship (the mothership) as a base of operations, hanging out disguised in geostationary orbit over area 51
			us government is aware of Bofaeockians (multiple alien species live on earth with a men-in-black style relationship) but not aware of the botnet

actual scoop - the scouting algorithm
	system to find the next Bofaeockian homeworld
	running hyper sophisticated model of the universe to find a planet that is livable and feasible to travel to
	consists of three major components - botnet, master server, and interface layer
	botnet
		uses human brains since those happen to be remarkably similar to Bofaeockian computers
		made up of human users of facebook products
		each human, while signing up for facebook or one of its subsidiary apps, is infected with a neurological virus, a routine running on the subconscious level that runs calculations and changes behavior
		the neurovirus does the following:
			compels people to visit social media in order to receive input and potentially software updates
			runs the inputs against the specified routines
			compels people to upload computational outputs as disguised as statuses and memes
			compels people to recruit others onto social media
	interface layer
		facebook, instagram, WhatsApp, etc
		uploads the neurovirus into people and serves as repository for output data
		the exact methods that are used to upload the virus are complex and numerous, but here are a few:
			viral videos and memes have software updates
			the number of likes you get indicate the quality of your data
			maybe the sign up process uses flashing light to upload the initial virus?
	master server
		huge wetware data center
		transforms the output data into actual simulation results
		holds the actual code for the neurovirus upload steps, and the compilation required to disguise those as legitimate application code
		might be the locus of the actual upload step?
			would be as follows: the master server is constantly scanning facebook and subsidiary apps to see when users sign up. it then beams the virus into their brain
