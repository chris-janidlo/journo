outline from outer space
	establish contact with travis
	interview him about his scoop
	details emerge slowly that he isn't what he says he is
	you may or may not discover that travis is an alien and that facebook is all a big Bofaeockian conspiracy
	we leave journo and you are prompted to choose what kind of story you want to publish based off what you've learned
	you're told how your story impacts the world

whistleblower - Travis Wagner
	eccentric
		prone to UFO conspiracy theories
		hobbies
			flying things - planes, drones
			astronomy
			interested in freud and other early psychologists?
	senior level facebook engineer
		E7/M2 in facebook system
			just below director level
			highest level that seems to still touch code
			leads teams "as if they were small startups within the larger environment" (as someone on Quora said)
			major focus is user acquisition/retention
	arrogant
	socially awkward - more comfortable with his computer than with other people
	incredibly gifted programmer, competent (but not sparkling) people manager
	socially conscious, genuinely wants to do good, but often blind to the privilege of his position
		morally repulsed by project helen and its hasty implementation
		wants a legacy, to leave the world in a better place
		wants to improve humanity, both because he's come to love it and because he pities its current state
	says he comes from rich family, attended prestigious Valley highschool then UC Berkeley
		went to berkeley for bachelors and phd
		worked a series of startups until being hired to facebook a couple years ago
		this is all fake, of course, but he only had to convince the people interviewing/hiring him at facebook, and Bofaeockian mind-control tech makes these things easy
	is actually an alien from the planet Bofaeock
		TODO: name?
		basically a Bofaeockian astronaut - has a "phd," physically fit, years of loyal military service
		was on the mothership for years working on the master server, but was called down by Zark a couple years ago
		thinks that manipulating humans without their consent is disgusting, and is conflicted between this and loyalty to superiors/homeworld

initial scoop - project helen
	encryption backdoor for us government

Bofaeock: a brief history
	highly technologically advanced, centuries beyond humans
		have developed limited FTL travel based on creating wormholes
			this requires exact knowledge of the location of your destination
			the wormhole tunneling method is extremely precise (an error of a few feet can offset the destination by thousands of lightyears) and resource intensive, so scouting teams need to be as certain as possible about their destinations
	once prosperous society, but they depleted their planet
		Bofaeock is only just barely alive - if they don't leave, they'll die within a generation
	scouting squad led by Zark Urckbemerg to find inhabitable planets
	they found that earth was close, and it looked promising
		when they arrived they realized that it wouldn't work long term due to generally toxic environment (filtering it out would only work short term)
		however, they realized that they could use humanity as a massive botnet to run their scouting software on
		established the scouting ship (the mothership) as a base of operations, hanging out disguised in geostationary orbit over area 51
			us government is aware of Bofaeockians (multiple alien species live on earth with a men-in-black style relationship) but not aware of the botnet

actual scoop - the scouting algorithm
	system to find the next Bofaeockian homeworld
	running hyper sophisticated model of the universe to find a planet that is livable and feasible to travel to
	consists of three major components - botnet, master server, and interface layer
	botnet
		uses human brains since those happen to be remarkably similar to Bofaeockian computers
		made up of human users of facebook products
		each human, while signing up for facebook or one of its subsidiary apps, is infected with a neurological virus, a routine running on the subconscious level that runs calculations and changes behavior
		the neurovirus does the following:
			compels people to visit social media in order to receive input and potentially software updates
			runs the inputs against the specified routines
			compels people to upload computational outputs as disguised as statuses and memes
			compels people to recruit others onto social media
	interface layer
		facebook, instagram, WhatsApp, etc
		uploads the neurovirus into people and serves as repository for output data
		the exact methods that are used to upload the virus are complex and numerous, but here are a few:
			viral videos and memes have software updates
			the number of likes you get indicate the quality of your data
			maybe the sign up process uses flashing light to upload the initial virus?
	master server
		huge wetware data center
		transforms the output data into actual simulation results
		holds the actual code for the neurovirus upload steps, and the compilation required to disguise those as legitimate application code
		might be the locus of the actual upload step?
			would be as follows: the master server is constantly scanning facebook and subsidiary apps to see when users sign up. it then beams the virus into their brain
