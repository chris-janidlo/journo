Project is currently in a tech demo state. Might work on it in the future and write out an actual story, and you can see some of the lore I had initially planned in here as well, if you're interested.



Everything needed to work on this is in the repo. Only uses a few cloud tools:
* [hosting](https://crass-sandwich.itch.io/journo)
* [deploying](https://travis-ci.org/crassSandwich/journo/)
* [high level conversation map](https://www.draw.io/#HcrassSandwich%2Fjourno%2Fmaster%2Fstorymap%2FJourno%20Story%20Map%20%5Bskip%20ci%5D.html)

Conversation map is saved to this repo. The html file it uses both stores the data and automatically pulls up the cloud editor if you open it, which is cool. The file has [skip ci] in the name so that Travis doesn't rebuild every time I make a change to something that's just for design organization purposes.
