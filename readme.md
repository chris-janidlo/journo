Only public because of Travis CI. Feels cute but might make it private later idk ðŸ˜‘

Everything needed to work on this is in the repo. Only uses a few cloud tools:
* [hosting](https://crass-sandwich.itch.io/journo)
* [deploying](https://travis-ci.org/crassSandwich/journo/)
* [high level conversation map](https://www.draw.io/#HcrassSandwich%2Fjourno%2Fmaster%2Fstorymap%2FJourno%20Story%20Map%20%5Bskip%20ci%5D.html)

Conversation map is saved to this repo. The html file it uses both stores the data and automatically pulls up the cloud editor if you open it, which is cool. The file has [skip ci] in the name so that Travis doesn't rebuild every time I make a change to something that's just for design organization purposes.
